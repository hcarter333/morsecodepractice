This file is intended for local use with a Chrome browser. Download the html file to your machine, then open it in Chrome. It uses the ARRL morse code letter sound mp3s located at
http://www.arrl.org/code-characters
It just puts an easier to use (for us) interface on the files.  Click a letter, and the 5 wpm Morse code sound will play for that latter.
